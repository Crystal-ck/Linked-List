We have two classes Node and Linked list.
The class Node contains pass to act as a place holder since you cant leave a class empty.
The class Linked List has multiple methods:
|createNode- that creates a new node and returns it|
|set_head - sets the head of the linked list as empty|
|append - allows for new nodes to be added at the end of the list or if there is no head the new node it set as head|
|display- checks if the list is empty if not it displays the nodes in the list|
